<p>Dyson has revealed plans to build a new battery factory in Singapore, alongside investments by the maker of vacuum cleaners and dryers in technology centres in the UK and the Philippines. The company, run by the billionaire Sir James Dyson, said the investments in Bristol in the UK and Santo Tomas in the Philippines would be worth £100m and £166m respectively. The Singapore investment will be significantly larger. The plan continues Dyson’s strategy of basing its manufacturing operations outside the UK while retaining research and development functions in the UK, including its research and robotics facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington in Wiltshire. James Dyson was among the most prominent business supporters of the UK leaving the EU, arguing that the UK would gain more than it would lose. However, in 2019 he faced a barrage of criticism for moving the company’s headquarters to Singapore, where it already had factories. Dyson said the west Singapore plant would be its biggest ever investment in “advanced manufacturing”. With the Philippines technology centre, which will hire 400 new engineers, the investments will double the amount of factory space dedicated to advanced technologies, the company said. The central Bristol site will host hundreds of software and AI engineers, although the company said it would replace existing office space. The chief engineer, Jake Dyson, the founder’s son, said the Bristol site would hire more “software, AI and connectivity engineers”. Dyson said it would make batteries with proprietary new technology at the Singapore plant. It declined to give more details on the battery technology that would be used, citing commercial sensitivities, but it is understood that the company believes it can make smaller, lighter and more energy-dense batteries to power its gadgets. Battery technology development had been a key part of Dyson’s plans – since abandoned due to the huge costs – to manufacture an electric car. James Dyson said the “next-generation battery technology will drive a major revolution in the performance and sustainability of Dyson’s machines”. Jake Dyson has previously announced work on robots capable of carrying out basic household chores, a potential growth area for a company whose sales are largely made up of products that move air – ranging from fans and hand dryers to hairdryers and vacuum cleaners – although it also sells lamps and hair straighteners. The new buildings are part of a previously announced plan to invest £2.75bn over five years.</p>
