<p>US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday said human drivers must pay attention at all times after videos emerged of people wearing what appeared to be Apple’s recently released Vision Pro headset while driving Teslas. Buttigieg responded on Twitter/X to a video that had more than 24m views of a Tesla driver who appeared to be gesturing with his hands to manipulate a virtual reality field. Despite their names, Tesla’s assisted driving features – Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving – do not mean the vehicles are fully autonomous, Buttigieg said on Monday on social media. “Reminder – ALL advanced driver assistance systems available today require the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times,” Buttigieg said. Apple’s Vision Pro was released last week and blends three-dimensional digital content with a view of the outside world. Apple, which says people should never use it while operating a moving vehicle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Vision Pro was revealed in June as a headset that allows users to interact with “apps and experiences” in an augmented reality (AR) version of their own surroundings or in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) space, said Alan Dye, Apple vice-president of human interface design. “Apple Vision Pro relies solely on your eyes, hands and voice,” Dye said in June. “You browse the system simply by looking. App icons come to life when you look at them; simply tap your fingers together to select, and gently flick to scroll.” “Apple Vision Pro will change the way we communicate, collaborate, work and enjoy entertainment,” Apple executive Tim Cook said. However, the company never intended the Vision Pro to change the way people commute. Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Buttigieg has made similar comments previously about the use of Tesla’s autopilot. Tesla says its advanced driver features are intended for use with a fully attentive driver “who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment”.</p>
