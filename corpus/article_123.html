<p>Re your article on Apple’s autocorrect feature (Ducking hell! Apple to tweak autocorrect that replaces one of the most common expletives, 6 June), one of my daughter’s WhatsApp messages was mangled by the omniscient app, so she sent another: “Bloody autocorrect!”. This was inexplicably transmuted to “Bloody auto cucumber”. We now send emoticons for the aforementioned bodily fluid and unintended vegetable when our communications are altered. Prof Stephanie Pywell Hitchin, Hertfordshire • Thank you for the memories invoked by the picture of Roger Thorpe in his garage in Castleton, Derbyshire (Vintage repair garage and workshop in Derbyshire, 6 June). He repaired my 1959 Austin-Healey Sprite Mk 1, known as a “frogeye”, in 1972 when I was working in an outdoor centre in Castleton and my wife was a teacher in the village school. It is amazing to see him again after all these years, and in the same garage. Pete Brook Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, Anglesey • Recorder playing is alive and well in Lewes, for retirees at least (Letters, 6 June). Our leader, Jill, runs two thriving University of the Third Age groups. We’re about to make our first public appearance and we’re rehearsing a programme of four-part pieces that include sopranino, descant, treble, tenor and bass instruments for an end-of-year celebration gathering. Tootle-toot! Jenny Cobley Lewes, East Sussex • Re your article (London school drops ‘Sir’ and ‘Miss’ honorifics to fight cultural misogyny, 6 June), at my high school in Liverpool we had to address female teachers as “Sir”. Hugh Edwards Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.</p>
