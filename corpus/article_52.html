<p>Kate Winslet used her Bafta speech to ask the government for more protection against ‘harmful’ content on social media. Winslet who won best actress award for her role in I am Ruth, which explores the relationship between mother and child (played by daughter Mia Threapleton) dealing with mental health pressure from social media. Winslet called on “people in power” to “criminalise harmful content,” telling the ceremony: “I Am Ruth was made for parents and their children, for families who feel that they are held hostage by the perils of the online world, for parents who wish they could still communicate with their teenagers, but who no longer can.” The online safety bill, which is progressing through the House of Lords, requires social networks to protect children from harmful content, with fines of up to 10% of global turnover for those services that do not comply. We would like to hear from parents on how they feel about the impact on children of online content that could be deemed offensive, disturbing or harmful. What issues have you experienced? We will contact you, if we wish to take your submission further and before we publish.</p>
