<p>Apple has announced it will upgrade its autocorrect feature that annoyingly corrects one of the most common expletives to “ducking”. “In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief at the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino on Monday. TechCrunch reported that iOS 17 will feature an upgraded autocorrect powered by AI. Over time, the AI model will learn to predict words and phrases that the iPhone user repeats, including swear words. Cnet said iOS 17 is expected to be available as a public beta in July, with the general release to come out in September. The iPhone autocorrect feature has always had its quirks, at times taking a misspelled word and substituting it with what it deems a logical option, but which ends up changing the meaning of a particular phrase or sentence. Such occurrences generally produce follow-up texts along the lines of “damn autocorrect!” But the “ducking” substitution is a longstanding source of mirth or frustration, depending on how many times one has had to rewrite their own texts or scream at one’s own device. Apart from the texting tweak, the company had a lot more on its agenda – an expensive new mixed-reality headset and details on a revamped desktop and laptop. Apple shares hit an all-time high on Monday, putting the company’s market valuation just shy of $3tn, which would also be a record. Its gains of 280% over the past five years demonstrates the power of the iPhone’s market share. Of course, iPhone users have always had the option to turn off the autocorrect feature on their phones, which would allow its foul-mouthed users to be as profane as they want. With Reuters</p>
