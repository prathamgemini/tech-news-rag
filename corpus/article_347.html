<p>Meta has launched a web version of its “Twitter killer” social media platform Threads that can be used without an app, as it attempts to revive itself after a recent drop in usage. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp launched the microblogging site in July, widely understood as an alternative for users disillusioned with Elon Musk-owned Twitter, which has since rebranded as X. Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the release of the desktop version on Tuesday, with a photo of his younger self in his dorm room posted on Threads, captioned: “Actual footage of me building Threads for web. Rolling out over the next few days.” The web browser functionality takes it a step closer to matching what X offers. Threads experienced an initial boom in sign-ups after it was first launched on 5 July, with 100 million new users registering within a week. However, just three weeks later, the number of users who engaged with the site on a daily basis had dropped significantly. It had a peak of 49 million users shortly after its launch, but on 22 July that had fallen to 12 million active users, according to the internet traffic analysts Similarweb. Threads was launched during a period of instability on the then Twitter platform, with Musk instituting massive staff cuts and changes to moderation enforcement and functionality that have prompted a backlash from users and advertisers. Meta’s answer to Twitter was launched shortly after one of Musk’s widely criticised moves as owner, his decision to cap the daily number of tweets users could view on the platform. Zuckerburg launched Threads as a new space for real-time updates and to have public conversations, and the interface is similar to X – where users can engage, repost and like each other’s content. This month, the Meta and X competitive saga continued after Zuckerberg said he was moving on from talking about a possible cage fight with Musk, accusing the Tesla chief executive of not being “serious” about the idea. The fight was initially suggested by Musk in response to efforts by Meta to launch a Twitter competitor. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
