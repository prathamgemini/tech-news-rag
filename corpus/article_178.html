<p>Whether itâ€™s due to the cost of living crisis or problems accessing help with digital literacy, people of all ages find themselves excluded from digital services. We would like to hear about the ways you, or your family and friends are digitally excluded. Perhaps you do not have access to broadband at home or find digital tasks difficult. How does it affect your daily life? How do you feel about this? This Community callout closed on 5 September 2023. You can see the article that included respondents to this callout here.
