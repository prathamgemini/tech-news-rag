<p>Google’s latest smartphone launch packs its Pixel devices with AI, an object-measuring temperature sensor and extended software support for up to seven years. Announced alongside the second-generation of its Pixel smartwatch and the launch of Android 14, the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro hope to go toe-to-toe with Apple’s iPhone 15 line while following the pioneering Fairphone’s lead with longer-lasting devices. Pixel 8 and 8 Pro The Pixel 8 starts at £699 (€799/$699) has a 6.2in 120Hz OLED screen and is slightly smaller and lighter than its predecessor. An improved dual-camera system on the back captures 21% more light for better low-light performance and includes a macrophotography mode. The new “best take” feature will allow users to swap faces between multiple frames to create photos where everyone is smiling or looking in the same direction. The photo editor feature will allow you to resize subjects in shotsand apply other effects using generative AI, while a new “audio magic eraser” can remove background sound in videos, such as crowd noise. The £999 (€1,099/$999) Pixel 8 Pro has the same software features plus a larger 6.7in screen and a third 5x optical zoom telephoto camera on the back. The phone has a temperature sensor that enables users to measure objects such as walls, phones and other devices, with health-related features enabled in the future. The 8 Pro also has manual camera controls and a “video boost” feature that uses AI on the device and Google’s data centres to provide Night Sight video and other modes due later this year. Both phones will have Google’s new top Tensor G3 chip and AI features, including the ability to summarise articles, read them aloud and translate them, plus enhanced grammar and proofreading features. Lastly, software support will be extended to seven years from release – two more years than previous models and longer than most other manufacturers including Samsung. Apple typically offers a similar seven years of updates while Fairphone recently broke ground by offering up to 10 with its latest phone. Pixel Watch 2 Google’s smartwatch was also updated with a refined design that is now 10% lighter, but maintains compatibility with previous-generation straps. The Pixel Watch 2 has a new faster quad-core chip and runs the latest WearOS 4, including the new Gmail and Calendar apps. The watch has new electrical stress sensors, a larger heart rate sensor on the back for more accurate measurements during exercise and revamped workouts with automatic recognition in the Fitbit app. The watch will cost from £349 and be available in-store from 12 October alongside the Pixel 8 phones. Android 14 The next version of Google’s Android software will start rolling out to devices starting with the firm’s Pixel smartphones and tablets from today, and coming to supported third-party devices in the near future. Android 14 includes greater customisation options for the lock screen, including generative AI wallpaper and AI that make features more prominent when needed, such as the weather widget when it’s raining. The new Health Connect system syncs your fitness and health data from third-party apps and encrypts it securely on the device, similar to Apple’s Health app on an iPhone, so that not even Google can access it.</p>
