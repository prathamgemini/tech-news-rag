<p>Two hours a day, three, even five: the time we spend on our screens is gradually ticking up. According to Nielsen, Americans now spend almost half of their days gazing into their various devices, while in the UK a study found that screen time has surged since pandemic lockdowns, with 50% of respondents clocking up 11 hours or more a day. Studies have also shown a collapse in our ability to concentrate. Nineteen years ago the researcher Gloria Mark began logging when office workers switched tasks on their computers. In 2004, the average time the workers spent before changing their focus was two and a half minutes; it’s now 47 seconds. As part of a new editorial project we’re launching this summer, we want to know more about how you feel about your relationship with your smartphone. Are you happy with the amount of time you spend on it? Are there any habits you’d like to break? Have you tried anything to limit your phone use?</p>
