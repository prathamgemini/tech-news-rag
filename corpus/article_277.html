<p>Samsung has unveiled its next-generation devices with folding screens, including the popular Z Flip phone, alongside new water-resistant premium tablets and Galaxy Watch smartwatches. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 were unveiled on Wednesday at an event in the company’s home country of South Korea, alongside a new series of Tab S9 Android tablets and the Galaxy Watch 6 running Google’s Wear OS software. Galaxy Z Flip 5 The market-leading Flip series has been upgraded with a much larger outside cover screen that be used for quick replies to messages, widgets and as a view finder for taking selfies with the pair of main 12-megapixel cameras. The internal folding screen also has a new water-drop hinge design that reduces the crease in the middle of the display and allows the phone to fold fully flush with no gap along the sides when closed, which is 25% more durable, the company says. Compared with its predecessor, the water-resistant Z Flip 5 is thinner, lighter and has Qualcomm’s faster Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. But it is also £50 more expensive, costing from £1,049 in the UK or $999 in the US and will be in store on 11 August. Galaxy Z Fold 5 Samsung’s pioneering folding phone-tablet hybrid has also received some significant refinements for its fifth generation. The Z Fold 5 has the same improved water-drop hinge design as the Flip, allowing it to shut without a gap at the sides. The inside screen is brighter, 25% more durable and supports the use of a stylus. The ultra-premium device is thinner, lighter and faster than its predecessor, fitted with five cameras on the back, front and inner screen. The Z Fold 5 will start at £1,749 in the UK or $1,799 in the US and be in store on 11 August. With Google’s slick Pixel Fold going on sale at the start of July for the same price, Samsung finally has some real competition for the cutting-edge devices making the Z Fold 5 key to ensuring the firm’s dominance in the hottest part of the smartphone market. Galaxy Tab 9 Samsung’s premium Android tablet line becomes some of the first with water resistance for its next generation. The Tab S9, S9+ and S9 Ultra all have the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, slick AMOLED displays, stylus support and 5G options, differentiated by screen size ranging from 11in to 14.6in on the diagonal. The premium iPad competitors have advanced Android software that can turn them into laptop replacements including connecting to external monitors, with optional keyboard case accessories available. The Tab S9 series will start at £799 in the UK or $799 in the US and be in store on 11 August. Galaxy Watch 6 Lastly, Samsung’s smartwatch line has also been upgraded with faster chips, more memory and larger batteries, which are expected to address one of the biggest pain points for the devices. The Galaxy Watch 6 comes in four sizes each with 20% larger displays, and marks the return of Samsung’s popular physical rotating bezel on the Classic versions. The watches have a new quick-release watch strap system similar to the Apple Watch and next-generation Wear OS 4 software with at least five years of updates. The Watch 6 starts at £289 in the UK or $299 in the US and be in store on 11 August, making it significantly cheaper than Google’s Pixel Watch and the biggest competitor to the dominant Apple Watch, but for Android users.</p>
