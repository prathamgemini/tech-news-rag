<p>While Coco Khan (27 March) rightly highlights how “weird” LinkedIn is (who doesn’t loathe the bragging and happy clapping?), she shouldn’t damn the entire platform. It enables millions of small enterprises such as mine to professionally connect with peers and potential clients. And yes, this means establishing brand and credibility. If she craves “a bit of real and refreshing honesty”, she may connect with me and discover how many highly talented and ethical peacebuilders, humanitarians and philanthropists are actively committed to bringing justice and peace to our world. Dr Susan Laverick Geneva, Switzerland • Our granddaughter turned 18 on Easter Monday. When she was born we kept the Guardian for that day. The front-page headline was “Secret foreign cash funded Tory campaign” – arguments about how the Conservatives raised money. Some things never change. Eric Baldwin Brentwood, Essex • Having spent six months growing new feathers and laying nothing but turds, our 10-year-old Black Rock laid us an egg – the size of a pigeon’s, but undeniably an egg – just in time for Easter. By way of celebration, we sent a picture of it to our son. His reply read: “What an oeuf is that!” Griff Everett Milford, Derbyshire • Delighted to see you focus on this important group (UK invertebrate of the year, 2 April). Disappointed to find no subcategory for politicians. Matthew Slack Kerrera, Argyll and Bute • The first major benefit of the post-Brexit Australian-UK trade deal: Waitrose is stocking Tim Tams. Alasdair Gibson Ledbury, Herefordshire • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it. A selection will be published in our Readers’ best photographs galleries and in the print edition on Saturdays.</p>
