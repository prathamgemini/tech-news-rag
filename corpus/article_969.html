<p>Apple is working to fix a problem that has resulted in some users complaining that their iPhone alarms are not going off – or playing too quietly. The company said it was aware of the issue, which has been picked up by TikTok users, who have complained about incidents where their alarm has failed to sound. “This has probably been the third or fourth day in a row that my alarm clock has not gone off,” said one TikTok user. Another said: “I’ve noticed for the past week or so my alarm just wasn’t waking me up.” Users said the problem was causing them timekeeping problems. Apple said it was working to fix the problem quickly, although it is not clear how many people have been affected or what devices are involved. Another TikTok user, in a video that has garnered nearly 10m views, said their iPhone 15 alarm had gone off at “the lowest volume” and claimed the problem was related to an “attention aware” feature being enabled on their phone. “Apple are you trying to get people fired?” the user added. Apple declined to comment on whether the feature was the reason for the alarm problem, which was first reported by NBC’s Today programme. The attention aware feature lowers the sound of alerts if users are looking at their device. If you are looking at your phone it also dims the display until you stop looking at it. Apple has an online advice page on alarms, which points to controlling the alarm volume via the “Sounds &amp; Haptics” feature under settings, adding that the “do not disturb” and “silent mode” options do not affect the alarm sound. The page also recommends that users check their alarm sound is not set to “none”.</p>
