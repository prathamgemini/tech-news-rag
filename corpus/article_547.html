<p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was hospitalized for a “minor but real stroke” on Thursday in Mexico City while he was in the city to speak at a business conference. After a brief stay in the hospital, he said he was “flying home,” according to ABC News. Wozniak, 73, told ABC he was at his computer in the morning when he felt vertigo and dizziness. He had been scheduled to speak at the World Business Forum in Mexico City, a two-day gathering billed as the world’s most important management event. Other advertised speakers were Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, and Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer in microfinance who was awarded the Nobel peace prize. The convivial Wozniak, who teamed up with the late Steve Jobs to found Apple in 1976, had been scheduled as the conference’s closing speaker on Wednesday afternoon. He did not make the scheduled speech. Wozniak suffered the “health problem” shortly before he was scheduled to arrive at the event, the source said, declining to detail what the health problem was. Wozniak left Apple in 1985 to pursue a wide range of other interest, but has remained a fervent supporter of the company and a technology evangelist. More recently, he has pursued a range of other interests including competing on Dancing With the Stars in 2009 and participating as a judge in an online video show called Unicorn Hunters that assesses ideas from entrepreneurs vying to build startups potentially worth $1bn or more. While dabbling in other startups, Wozniak also has helped keep alive the memory of his longtime friend, Jobs, who died of cancer in 2011.</p>
