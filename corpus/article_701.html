<p>Microsoft is cutting about 1,900 jobs at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week, per an internal memo from the head of the company’s gaming division. The cuts represent about 9% of the overall Microsoft Gaming division, which employs roughly 22,000 people, with most of the layoffs set to happen at video game publisher Activision Blizzard. The president of the subsidiary, Mike Ybarra, is also leaving the company. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. “I want to thank everyone who is impacted today for their meaningful contributions to their teams, to Blizzard, and to players’ lives,” Ybarra wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “To the Blizzard community: I also want to let you all know today is my last day at Blizzard.” Microsoft closed its $69bn deal for Activision Blizzard in October, boosting its heft in the video-game market with best-selling titles including Call of Duty to better compete with industry leader Sony. The news follows job cuts at several other big firms including Alphabet, eBay and Amazon, which have signaled that the widespread pruning seen across the tech industry last year will continue in 2024. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers last year.</p>
